# Ubuntu-Launchpad
The Ubuntu version of Apple's/MacOS Launchpad application. The shortcut is meant to be placed on a dock as a keyboard-free alternative to pressing Super+A.

## Development Tutorial
In Terminal run:
```
sudo apt install dh-make devscripts
```

Then run:
```
sudo gedit .bashrc
```

Add your information to the end of the file (mine below, I used an URL instead of email):
```
export DEBEMAIL="https://github.com/milan102"
export DEBFULLNAME="Milan Mishra"
```

Create a folder called launchpad-1.0 and place the shell script inside
- Add a .desktop file and a .png file
- Edit the .desktop file to Exec where the shell script will be placed and set Path to that folder (more on that below)

From inside the launchpad-1.0 folder, run:
```
dh_make --indep --createorig --copyright mit
```

Inside the newly generated debian folder:
- Create an install file that specifies where the files in launchpad-1.0 get installed to (the paths are used in the .desktop file)
- Edit the rules file and add ```override_dh_usrlocal:```
- Edit the control file by changing Section, Homepage, Depends, and Description

Create a folder outside launchpad-1.0 called ```post-dh_make-files```
Back up the finalized install, rules, and control files in here so that they don't need to be edited each time on future runs of dh_make and instead can be copied+pasted into the generated debian folder

From inside the launchpad-1.0 folder, run:
```
debuild -us -uc
```

Distribute the generated .deb file as an application installer

Thanks to https://blog.packagecloud.io/eng/2016/12/15/howto-build-debian-package-containing-simple-shell-scripts/ for providing a great starting point with regard to packaging shell scripts into deb files
